				<h1>Concept of the Lab</h1>
					<p>This lab we headed onto an adventure to design our site with even more fancy css skills. This included rounded borders, gradient backgrounds, text shadows, and etc. We did this lab to build our skills with designs.</p>

					<h2>Problems Encountered</h2>
						<p>Every thing was straightforward. I was able to design everything how I wanted it too. However, I could not get my back button to move where I wanted it to. I wanted to move it down, closer to my concept section. I was only able to move it horizontally. Definitely a question to ask the professor.</p>

				<div id="results">
					<h3>Results</h3>
						<p>I was able to make my site realy nice and how I wanted it. I made a gradient that really complements with my background. I was able to make a cool, readable text showdow, and I added a background image, which was the first time for me. I had a more fun, easier time with this lab than the typography labs. </p>
