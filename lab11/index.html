			<h1>Subject of Lab</h1>
				<p1>During today's lab we explored more advanced ways to style block levels. We were using different ids, floats, and commands like sticky. I think the hardest part of this was creating the sticky bar.</p1>
			<h2>Difficulties</h2>
				<p2>This lab has been more of an challenge than most. I have problems trying to figure out on how to creat a sticky bar. I could not get it and I will ask a question about it. This lab I did take a little longer on just becasue we did more advanced styling.</p2>
			<h3>Results</h3>
				<p3>This is probably my favorite lab I have done so far. I really like the triad color scheme and I think I pushed myself more to style this one nicely.</p3>

			<h4>Sidebar Fun</h4>
				<p4>Fun Fact 1: I enjoy playing baseball. I have been playing baseball for 15 years and I hope to join CSUMB on the field next summer.</p4>
				<p5>Fun Fact 2: I am kind of into cars. More specifically, my car. I drive a 2003 Chevy Impala. I know it is not fast but I beleive my car is fast, so that is all that matters.</p5>
				<p6>Where to begin... Hamburgers give me life. Everytime I crunch into a nice, thick, juicy, In N Out burger I feel as if I am eating a bag of rainbows. Burgers have always gave me a smile and will always continue to give me a smile.</p6>
