			<p id="goldone">Today for Lab 9 we took a look at how to style block elements in html using CSS. We used ids, paddings, and borders. This was the thrid part in getting to know CSS and how to use it.<p>
			<h2 id="bluetwo">Challenges Faced</h2>
			<p id="goldtwo">Like most days, the biggest challenges were figuring out and remebering how to write certain things out. Besides that, I might of had a problem with trying to figure out how to put a border around my image and text. I figured out the text but not the image.<p>
			<h3 id="bluethree">Results</h3>
			<p id="goldthree">every time we figure something out with css or html, it is always satasfying. We were able to understand borders and paddings. The biggest concern that I want to bring up is how to create a border around my image when its in a content border<p>
