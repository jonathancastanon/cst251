			<h1>Subject of Lab</h1>
				<div id=hover>
					<p id=blue>This lab was in continuation of Monday's fancy css lab. Today, we explored anmations, transitions, colums, and background images. This was here to help us begin to start thinking like desgners and create awesome pages. </p>
				</div>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<div id=hover>
					<p id=blue>The biggest problem I had for this lab was creating my text to appear from transparent to color. First, I experimented with boxes and it was transtioning every header and text. Next, I had some problems with the transition effect for my headers. I wanted to be able to transition back to white as well. </p>
				</div>
			<h3>Results</h3>
				<div id=hover>
					<p id=blue>After figuring out how to perate and class everyhting I was able to make the text appear and change throughout the screen duration. Although it is not a well design pagd. I still had a big challenge with this lab. at least I can say I tried. </p>
