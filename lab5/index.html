	<h1>Subject of This Lab</h1>
		<p>In today's lab we explored some more html. We learned how to add links to our page and hide a link within an image. We also created a link back to our home page where we have all of our other pages connected.</p>
	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
		<p>Our first difficulity was that we did not realize that we did not close our anchor tag for 30 minutes. Becasue of this, all of our images were being linked to the website we wanted to go. Our second difficulty was that my partner's back home link was not working on safari, but we changed his default browser and it worked on chrome.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>The results were very much wanted and needed. Our page looks and works how we wanted it to. All of our links work and all of the images show up.</p>
