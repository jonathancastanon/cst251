			<p>Hello my name is Jonathan Castanon but you can call my J. I moved around California a little but; first I was born in Lodi, CA and moved to Jamestown, CA. Then after 4-5 years I moved to Stockton, CA where I have been living my life. I have played baseball for 14 years and I strive to play at CSUMB. I love to make Youtube videos about sports and just having fun with friends. I love the west coast, which was the main reason why I want to call Monterey Bay my home for 4 years.</p>
