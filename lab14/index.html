			<h1>Subject of our Lab</h1>
				<p>The subject of this lab was to recreate another web typographic site. except, the challenge was for it to be more cmpliated. Well... mission accomplished. This was a test of my abilities.</p>
			<h2>Difficulties I faced</h2>
				<p>I wanted to put my image above my text, kind of lik layering in photoshop. I could not get this to work, the image and text whould not cooperate with one another. The image floated on top or beneath the text but never on top or under. I was vry confused on how to do it that. I claim this lab as an acual defat, my first ever lab I could not figure out. </p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
				<p>I was able to style some parts like backgrounds, text, and colors but I could not do the complicated ones. This is leaving me wanting to as questions when I get back into class. </p>
