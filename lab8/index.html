		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p id="red-one">I had many challenges. First I wanted to make my text a gradient color and I could not figure that out. I also could not figure out how to create a background image for my site. I believe this was my most challenging yet. I also had trouble with some of the selectors and how to use them. I felt kind of overwhelmed.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p id="white-one">I had problems with changing my font style earlier. I thought maybe google did not have the font. It turned out I did not have my font typed in correctly.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p id="blue-one">The results were not too bad. I have different styles and fonts and colors going on.</p>
