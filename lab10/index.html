			<h1 id="madbum">Subject of the Lab</h1>
			<p id="baseball">Today for this lab, we worked on styling our text elements. What I changed was the color of my text as well as my font. I added the font family and my font link ref.</p>
			<h2 id="madbum2">Difficulties Faced</h2>
			<p id="baseball2">Changing the color and font of my text was fairly simple and easy for me, My hardest issue was trying to create a border with the images. It took a lot of trial and error. I realized I did not link my style sheet to my page.</p>
			<h3 id="madbum3">Outcome</h3>
			<p id="baseball3">I added a border around my text with images and I changed the font as well.</p>
