	<h1>Subject of This Lab</h1>
		<p>For this lab, we are commiting and pushing all of our work we have done through the past labs to it's orgin. We pretty much creating our local files and making them into public, or server files, that everyone can see. We will be taking screen shots from our work to prove how we are doing.</p>
	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
		<p>through out the beginning processes we have been able to get through everything fast and smoothly. However, it was a different story with Lab 3. As we were partaking in the activity, we found it challenging to add images and size them appropiatly. Our images would go all over the place and take up a lot of room. We did manage to figure it out and we made a pretty cool website.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>We are very proud of what we have made. Our webiste has numerous working links, images and text. Some of our elements took time and tears but we figured it out and our problem solving has been "a1".</p>
