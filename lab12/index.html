			<h1>Subject of the Lab</h1>
				<p>For today's lab we explored the difficulities of advanced block styling. We attempted to go more in depth on how to style our html. Exclusively, centering, floating, and styling images. </p>
			<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
				<p>Can I say everything? I beleive this was defitnely our hardest lab. We had challenges with centering and styling our items. This included human error and lack of knowledge. Figuring out where to place our ids and divs was most troublesome.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
				<p>The results of this lab are not the best and not my favorite. I would like to say I did everything right bbut I cant. I did try my best though.</p>
