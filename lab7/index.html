		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>In today's Lab we had some trouble with remebering all the different types of styles we could do with our CSS. Also, we ran into trouble with saving a lot of our stuff. I beleive they were all mindless stuff and we corrected them easily.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I had some trouble with my JPG file being capitalized. Once I fixed that I still realized I was getting a broken image. I also mistakenly placed it into my css folder and not my img folder.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>Our page turned out to be a really cool colered, working site.</p>
