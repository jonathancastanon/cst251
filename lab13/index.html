			<h1>Subject of the Lab</h1>
				<p>The subject of this lab was to replicate a typography-design based website. We first researched typograpy based websites and picked one that we wanted to replicate. Along with creating two seperate htmls and css, we had to link on with the other and design each one. Tis lab was to begin understandig how to make complex things with type.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>My biggest challange for this lab was creating the right spacing for my fake index letters. Othr than that, I beleive I was able to create new HTMLs and CSS's easily.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
				<p>I was able to figure out a way to create spacing in-between my letters. For each letter, I placed a span tag around it and it allowed me to change the color, size, and margins. I used the negative margins to create less space between the letters. </p>
